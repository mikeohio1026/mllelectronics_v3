Parts are still available for this laser however they are becoming rare as time goes on. The purpose of this page is provide reference materials for future owners and operators of this machine.
Hardware Overview The controller is a custom controller made by GCC Mercury and is nearing the end of its useful life.</description></item><item><title>Hackathons</title><link>https://mllelectronics.com/p/hackathons/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mllelectronics.com/p/hackathons/</guid><description>Introduction to Hackathons This a page is a curated selection of hackathon projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on over my 3+ years at the University of Akron. Most of the hacks on this page are hardware based. A large majority of my hacks involve rapid prototyping techniques such as 3d printing, laser cutting and development with the Arduino and ESP32 platforms. As hardware hackers it is not uncommon to carry around a large box of hardware so as a group we decided to build Auto Tank a robotic pack mule for hackathons as featured below.</description></item></channel></rss>
