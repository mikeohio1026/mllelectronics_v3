Hardware Overview Blimp V1 Badge Schematic
Software Needed to Run KiCad V5.1 - PCB Schematic and Electronic Design Software Arduino IDE - AVR as ISP to program the board Solidworks 2019 - Mechanical design software Inkscape - Vector graphics editor to design blimp shape Lessons Learned There were several lessons learned with this project as I had tight timeline to produce and finish this before the Fall 2019 career fair at UAkron.</description></item><item><title>Hackathons</title><link>https://mllelectronics.com/p/hackathons/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mllelectronics.com/p/hackathons/</guid><description>Introduction to Hackathons This a page is a curated selection of hackathon projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on over my 3+ years at the University of Akron. Most of the hacks on this page are hardware based. A large majority of my hacks involve rapid prototyping techniques such as 3d printing, laser cutting and development with the Arduino and ESP32 platforms. As hardware hackers it is not uncommon to carry around a large box of hardware so as a group we decided to build Auto Tank a robotic pack mule for hackathons as featured below.</description></item></channel></rss>
