## Projects 
Keyboard Warrior: A custom built STM32F303 keyboard running the QMK firmware.
* Goal: design and make a modular mechanical keyboard with ability to extend functionality over i2c (number pad, OLED display, etc)
* Schematic and board routing was done in KiCAD. With attention paid to crystal oscillator design, USB differential pair layout, and power supply design.
* Mechanical design was done in SolidWorks. A custom stacked aluminum case design was chosen due to simplicity and ability to easily fabricate.

LMS3990 CNC Conversion: A custom CNC Mill 
* Electronics consist of Mach 3 breakout board, custom high current stepper drivers based on TMC5160 driver with encoder feedback, and a spindle speed controller.
* Mechanically designed in SolidWorks. Converted from linear lead screws to a C7 grade ballscrew system with custom made motor mounts.

HAkron Public Relations Officer: Akronâ€™s Official College Hackathon Group
* Worked on expanding and engaging with engineering student organizations on campus in order to teach basic
programming and electronics.
* Hosted HAkron 4K a hackathon which is a 24 hour invention marathon that encourages creativity, innovation, learning
and engineering.
* Worked closely with a team to manage 80+ students and lead the electronics hardware team. Mentored several teams,
organized access to the Bounce Innovation hub makerspace, and gained experience in teaching troubleshooting to
non-technical individuals.
