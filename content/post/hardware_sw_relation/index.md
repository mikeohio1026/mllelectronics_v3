## HW - The phyiscal aspect of it 

We are going to focus on Electrical HW to be specific. Not mechanical stuff like steel, widgets etc. 

Workflow is simple idea to materials to stuff/product. What is not accounted for is the concept of SW. 

The concept of Bits and Atoms has been something I personally and focused only 

If we assume the brain is electrical currents and then we use it is also another intersting thing to consider yes it is so 

Atomic Engineering. I would also like to highlight startups I've seen or heard about in this area too. Its another post that is good.


My belif is the hybridization of these bits and atoms 

You can then talk about derivatives such as V Model popular in highly regulated industries such as aerospace, medical devices, and automotive to name a few. 

These are requirements and regulation driven industries where there is supposed to be a clear definition and supposedly all inputs and outputs are validated. 

## SBCE (Set Based Concurrent Engineering ) - Lean Hardware in Disguise??
