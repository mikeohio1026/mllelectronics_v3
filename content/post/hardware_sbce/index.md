## The Lean Methodologies 

The concept of Lean is a guiding philosophy that focuses on creating value with fewer resources and less waste. This philosophy focuses on the elimination of non-value add activities and waste from business by focusing on the needs of the customer. The customer itself is intentionally ambiguous at first but then requires introspection regarding the entire process flow. 

The concept of Agile flow which is software based framework that prioritizes iterative design, customer focused results and continous integration within the system to ensure early on that the customer needs are being meet. 

Primary users of Lean Methodologies are Manufacturing companies and Agile flows would be Software Development companies.

It is such an interesting dichotomy as both are very different with one focused on producing as many widgets as possible and another on implementing scalable solutions. The day to day management and functions that workers do in these industries are complete opposites but they have successfully implemented Lean Methodologies and Agile principles to provide a quality, consistent and customer focused output. 

I think there is little difference between these two ideas and would like to merge them into the concept of Lean and Agile driven HW product devlopment. 

The question I want to leave you with and ask is "What is the Product Development equivalent of Lean and Agile flow? Is it possible to bridge gap between these two very important concepts as the lines blur between hardware and software development?" 

I'd like to explore this idea more but first we must start with the basics. What is an alternative to lean amd agile based development. 

Traditional they break this down into several camps. One is Lean and another is non Lean (we call it waterfall). What exactly does waterfall mean and what does Lean mean to me. 

Waterfall development is a classic result of the time honored tradition of assembly based on intuition. The concept of step one to step two etc and this all happens sequentially. 

Example include the blacksmith making a nail its simple to create at small scale simply to take a piece of steel, heat it up and hammer it until pointy.

With this example you get a simple equation steel + heat + worker input = finished product. 

Scaling this becomes tricky - lots of externalities need to be considered both related to engineering but also in business, logisitics and other factors that just can't be understood until you are faced with that problem. 

Automation tends to be the answer for scaling this nail making operation - ensuring that proper systems are put into place to be able to scale. Without understanding the underlying feedback loops and what can be used to accelerate this its impossible to scale something. 

This works really well but then how do you consider the input of these loops and how to reduce the time it takes to provide feedback into these loops. 

Lean manufacturing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


You can draw parallels to the concept of prints, drawings and change orders which end up being the medium that is utilized to manage manufacturing.

I think this can managed by good requirements and system design practices. 

I tie Lean and Agile together as my focus is to create a hybridized approach toward development. 
Both the satisfaction of the customer whomever that may be and the ability to create less waste for developers is key. 

I think the usage of these SW workflows in the HW based world requires some massaging as the concept of move fast and break things doesn't work. 

HW leads times are long - its a physically hard project. Its supply chain intricacies, people and logistics makes it exponentially hard. 

Yet those that in manufacturing subscribe to Lean methodogiles.
Where high functioning SW teams subscribe to Agile. 

I think the key thing that is hard is abstraction. But you are bringing Hardware and Software closer than ever so it imperative that you align both. 

The concept of abstraction of SW and HW is newer as we have never really had to deal with it. When ENIAC came out the SW was punch cards was the interface now its the command line and cloud servers. 

Does the SW guy writing Python etc need to know the finite details probably no. But we need to know that HW/SW are tightly tied together.
Analog computing and bio computing has been a new trend. 

You need both analog and digital design you need a systems related approach to building things.

If these things are not considered you end up with a hard brick like object.

I think manufacturing is the same thing gone are the days of manual milling and now CNC automate things. You have the code and post processing you will spend as much as you did before but make it repeatable and accurate with SW. That's the key is that you have the tools needed to make this digital transformation. 

Yet they are slow to adopt as it the focus of waterfall is to make widget and go through the process. Yet they adapted to LEAN and Six Sigma. 

I think the Hardware and SW development can do the same â€“ let me outline this in the next article.
