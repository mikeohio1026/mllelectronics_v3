## The Lean Methodologies 

The concept of Lean is a guiding philosphy that focuses on creating value with fewer resources and less waste. This philosphy focuses on the elimination of non-value add activities and waste from business by focusing on the needs of the customer. The customer itself is intentionally ambigious at first but then requires introspection regarding the entire process flow. 

Primary users of Lean Methodologies are Manufacuturing companies and Software Development companies. It is such an interesting dichotomy as both are very different with one focused on producing as many widgets as possible and another on implementing scalable solutions. The day to day mangement and functions that workers do in these industries are complete oppisistes but they have sucessfully implemented Lean Methodologies to provide a quality, consistent and customer focused output. 

The question I want to ask is what is the Product Development equivalent of Lean is it possible to bridge gap between these two very important parts of product as the lines blur between hardware and software development?
